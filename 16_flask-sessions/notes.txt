2024-10-9
time spent: 1 hrs

- Request.args vs. Request.form are used to send and recieve data from GET and POST 
methods. 
- GET and POST are both insecure as they can be seen either in the URL or in the background. 
How can we fix this?
- You can have seperate methods for each GET and PUSH.
- Both args and form are seperate dictionaries.
- GET is default in HTML, but you can specify POST using method="POST"
- We can retrieve the values from these immutable dictionaries for login purposes.

time spent: 2 hrs

- Flasks sessions are dictionaries that can help store information even when the page is reloaded / changed URL.
    - You can store inputted data into flask sessions.
    - For Example: if the username is already in the session, then they should still be logged in.
- Flask sessions need a secret key.
- You can clear a session using session.clear()
- When signing up and then removing the hyperlink, it still brings you to the response page.

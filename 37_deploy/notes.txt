2025-03-21
time_spent: 1

- Restart Services (via spacebar)
- What is python wheel?
	- already installed?
- uWSGI - software that communicates between NGINX and Python Flask
- ufw?
- unable to connect?
- be sure not to make a typo: 500 is not equal to 5000
- must auto update run.py
- updating on desktop does not update droplet
- can change file name for uWSGI file; must also change it in the commands.

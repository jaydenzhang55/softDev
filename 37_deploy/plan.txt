1. Read over the entire GitHub Assignment twice with the group. Enumerate anything unclear.
2. Read the tutorial before acting on it.
3. Follow the tutorial entirely and ensure every checkpoint is met.
	- if any issues arise, team up and figure it out together.
4. Afterwards, reread the tutorial for clear understanding of all commands.
5. Try once again, but this time everyone else does it on their own machines.
6. Set up Domain and HTTPS protection if time allots.

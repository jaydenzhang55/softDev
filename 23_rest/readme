K23 -- Learning About and Using Rest APIs (Specifically NASA's API)
2024-11-21
time spent: 0.5

DISCO: 
- I would constantly get an SSL error, but I found a work around using the following:
<code>
import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
</code>
- urllib.request returns the file type of the URL.
- json.loads [json.load procures an error] is used to translate a json file into a python dictionary

QCC:
- What is the difference between hdurl vs url?
- What does service version mean?
- What is an SSL Error? And how do you fix it without having to use an import?
- Is there any library that combines the two imports we used today?
- What other APIs are available and have functionality? How are they properly used in Software Development (besides in websites)?

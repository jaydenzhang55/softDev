2024-10-21
time spent: 1 hrs

DISCOVERIES:
----------------------------------------------------
* sqlite3 "name of file w/ SQL database" to open
* you can use SQL statements (; or /), dot-commands (.), or
CLI comments (#)
* can output data using .mode (+ the format you want)
* DictReader() is a Python module used to read from
csv files.
* I/O means input and output.
* sqlite3.create(file param) creates a database file if not 
present.
* "SQLite is an embedded, server-less relational database 
management system."
* db.execute is used to add data into the SQL db.
* PRIMARY KEY is used in SQL to determine the ID
identifier in your csv file.
- If no ID is present, the SQL db will automatically 
assign one.
* The type of variable comes after the actual 
variable name in SQL.
* The python "next" function is used to return the next item 
from the iterator.
* CREATE and INSERT are two functions that you can
use in the SQL db.

QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS:
----------------------------------------------------
Q: I had problems with trying to insert the same ID
into the table. Is there any better way to preserve
each ID without having it autogenerate?
Q: How can I read SQL errors? Is there any way to 
understand them more effectively?
Q: Do I need the top row of each table inside my
SQL data table?
C: You can only view SQL errors through using
python3 on the specific file.

2025-01-07t

DISCO:
- you can access an HTML item in JS using it's ID: getElementById.
- similarly, you can also access an HTML tag in JS using getElementsByTagName.
- you can create an HTML item in JS using createElement.
- you can delete an HTML item using remove()
- you can use a shorthand for creating functions using =>
- can access classes of certain tags using .classList and add()

QCC:
- uses of const vs var?
- what other shortcuts can you use in JS?
- why does JS sometimes need and not need ";"? (mentioned in class but we wanted more clarifcation)
